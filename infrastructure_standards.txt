My Azure infrastructure standards:
- Always use private subnets for workloads
- Enable Network Watcher for security monitoring
- Use managed identities and service principals with least-privilege access
- All resources tagged with Environment, Project, Owner
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- Use managed services when possible (Azure postgres for flexible servers, AKS, etc.)
